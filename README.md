# Word Scramble Game

This repository features code for a timed word scramble game. The goal of the player is to unscramble sets of words within the time limit, with each set using one of many different categories of words. Each word unscrambled adds some additional time to the timer, and the player gets points based on the length and time taken to unscramble each word. This project was built using React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

Here is a sample screenshot of a game in progress:
